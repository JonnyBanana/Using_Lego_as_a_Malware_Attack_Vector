# Using Legos as a Malware Attack Vector


Simple demonstration on how to make LEGOS a vector for propagating malware.

One day I asked myself ... </br>
Is it possible to use apparently harmless objects for the purpose of spreading malware? </br>
The answer is: Of course yes ... </br>


</br>

<H3>How does it work?</H3>

In the end it is very simple, even if a little laborious, to recreate a similar attack.</br> 
In practice, just create a QR-code that contains the connection to a server (or web page) </br> 
that contains the malicious code, and then reproduce it with Lego bricks.


In my example I have used a simple CSS attack, which is capable of crashing various browsers.  </br> 
The attack has now been largely mitigated, but it still does its job,  </br> 
especially on outdated devices, or out-of-date browsers.

Obviously this is just an example for testing purposes, but malware of any kind </br>
can be processed, and then repurposed with this technique.

<H3>How it was done?</H3>

</br> 

<b>1:</b> Creation of code that will be inserted in a web page(also Github is good).</br>
Or you can use the attack I used in the example: https://github.com/JonnyBanana/safari-ie-reaper.github.io


<b>2:</b> Insert the infected web page into a QR Code. </br>
just use a web service like this: https://qr-code-generator.com/


<b>3:</b> Print the QR Code.


<b>4:</b> Sectorization of the QR-code.</br>
You can easily use some programs, but I wanted to have fun and I did it "old school style".</br>
If you opt for the program, perform this step first before printing the QR Code.

</br>

<b>5:</b> Now it's time to figure out how many blocks of lego bricks you need,</br> 
once you have a clear idea it's time to spend on ebay...

I think I spent about â‚¬ 50 on LEGO bricks, to recreate the QR Code. </br>
Obviously, leaving some bricks for future projects. You need both LEGO PLATES</br>
(for the bases and the creation of the QR-CODE blocks) </br>
and LEGO BRICKS (to hold the base together).



<b>6:</b> Once you have all the pieces, you must then reproduce 
the QR Code exactly with the LEGO bricks. </br>


<b>:</b> TEST IT! </br>
If all went well, the QR Code will be read easily by any QR Code Reader!</br>
If it doesn't work, try to figure out where the wrong block (s) is, </br>
otherwise unzip everything and start over ( they are LEGO ;) )
