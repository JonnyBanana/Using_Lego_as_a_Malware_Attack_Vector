# Using Legos as a Malware Attack Vector


Simple demonstration on how to make LEGOS a vector for propagating malware.

One day I asked myself ... </br>
Is it possible to use apparently harmless objects for the purpose of spreading malware? </br>
The answer is: Of course yes ... </br>

<H3>How does it work?</H3>

In the end it is very simple, even if a little laborious, to recreate a similar attack.</br> 
In practice, just create a QR-code that contains the connection to a server (or web page) </br> 
that contains the malicious code, and then reproduce it with Lego bricks.


In my example I have used a simple CSS attack, which is capable of crashing various browsers.  </br> 
The attack has now been largely mitigated, but it still does its job,  </br> 
especially on outdated devices, or out-of-date browsers.

Obviously this is just an example for testing purposes, but malware of any kind </br>
can be processed, and then repurposed with this technique.

<H3>How it was done?</H3>

- <b>1</b> Creation of code that will be inserted in a web page(also github is good).
